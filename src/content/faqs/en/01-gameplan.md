question: "How do you want to proceed?"
---

There are about 40 beach volleyball courts in the greater Zurich area. 
Not all of these courts are playable or suitable for tournaments. 
In a **first phase**, we want to get an **overview of the existing situation** and work with the city to make the **first improvements**:  

-provide rakes/sand sliders  
-install information boards for field maintenance  
-Improve/replace netting systems  
-install lines and antennas (where not available)  
-Reduce danger spots on fields/field boundaries

  
  
In the **next step** we would like to further promote **dialogue between the city and beach volleyball players** and find out how we can help to promote the sport in the city.
In doing so, we want to tackle things that **need more lead time and planning**:  

-New and better sand for existing fields  
-Create additional courts
