question: "Who is behind morebeachvolley.ch ?"
---

MOREBEACHVOLLEYBALL is a **community project** of beach volleyball players from Zurich.
The project was initiated by **Constantin, Joni and Matthias/Bunny**. 
All three have been playing beach volleyball in Switzerland for many years. 
Although a lot of people play beach volleyball, most of them are not organized through a club or an interest group.

This motivated us to start MOREBEACHVOLLEYBALL. 
As a **contact** we promote the exchange **between active players** and the **public administration**.
We see ourselves as complementary to existing clubs and are particularly committed to improving the infrastructure.
